# Network Overview

![network-diagram](./diagrams/network-overview.svg)

## VPC and Subnet

The network for the Vertex Project Template consists of a single [custom-mode VPC network](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc) and a single [regional subnetwork](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/subnets) resource, which is hard-coded to [`northamerica-northeast1`](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones) (i.e. Montr√©al). All notebook virtual machines are in this subnet.

## Cloud Network Address Translation (NAT)

[GCP Cloud NAT](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/overview) allows certain resources to create **outbound** connections to the internet. Address translation is only supported for inbound **response** packets only; no unsolicited inbound connections are allowed. A **regional** (i.e. `northamerica-northeast1`) external IP address for the cloud NAT instance is [automatically provisioned](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/ports-and-addresses) when the Cloud NAT resource is provisioned.

## Firewall

All outgoing traffic is evaluated against VPC-wide [firewall rules](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/firewalls), with a default deny rule for all egress. An exception is made for GitHub public IPs so that users can use GitHub for source control.

## Access via Authenticated HTTPS Proxy

To the best of our knowledge, [User Managed Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/introduction) in [Vertex Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/introduction) use an [Inverting Proxy](https://github.com/google/inverting-proxy) to enable `https` connections between a user on the public internet and a notebook on the private subnetwork. The diagram below (borrowed from Inverting Proxy documentation) shows the high-level request flow when a client accesses the notebook via the inverting proxy.

```
+--------+         +-------+         +-------+         +---------+
| Client |         | Proxy | <-(1)-- | Agent |         | Backend |
|        | --(2)-> |       |         |       |         |         |
|        |         |       | --(3)-> |       |         |         |
|        |         |       |         |       | --(4)-> |         |
|        |         |       |         |       | <-(5)-- |         |
|        |         |       | <-(6)-- |       |         |         |
|        | <-(7)-- |       |         |       |         |         |
|        |         |       | --(8)-> |       |         |         |
+--------+         +-------+         +-------+         +---------+
```

Neither the `proxy-forwarding-agent` ("Agent") nor the JupyterLab server ("Backend") are accessible from the public internet. The `proxy-forwarding-agent` initiates an outgoing request to a Google-managed proxy server, and this proxy server waits for incoming client requests on the public internet.

As part of the startup process of the Jupyterlab server (also managed by Google), the `proxy-forwarding-agent` sets up a connection with a Google-managed proxy server, and the proxy server provides a public URL that it is listening for requests on. The format of this URL will look something like `https://<random characters>-dot-<region>.notebooks.googleusercontent.com`. Users who visit this URL are taken though an [OAuth2.0 flow](https://oauth.net/2/) for authentication and authorization.

Authenticated and authorized users have their request to the proxy server forwarded to the `proxy-forwarding-agent` that initiated the original request. The `proxy-forwarding-agent` forwards traffic to the Jupyterlab server. The Jupyterlab server responds to the `proxy-forwarding-agent`, which responds to the proxy server, which responds to the client that made the request.

## DNS

A number of Google APIs need to be accessed for various purposes.
